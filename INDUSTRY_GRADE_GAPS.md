## üéØ Definition of "Industry-Grade"

To match Epic, Cerner, and Athenahealth, we need:

- ‚úÖ **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime, error monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Security:** HIPAA-compliant, audit logging, RBAC
- ‚úÖ **Performance:** <2s page load, optimized queries
- ‚úÖ **Usability:** Mobile-friendly, accessible, fast search
- ‚úÖ **Compliance:** Audit trails, data retention, privacy policies
- ‚úÖ **Scalability:** Can handle 1000+ patients, 100+ concurrent users
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability:** Tests, documentation, error handling

---

## üìä Current Grade: B- (Good, but not industry-grade yet)

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Core features complete
- ‚úÖ Modern tech stack
- ‚úÖ Good UI/UX (Epic-style)
- ‚úÖ Internationalization

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ùå No error monitoring
- ‚ùå Incomplete audit logging
- ‚ùå No rate limiting
- ‚ùå No tests
- ‚ùå Security gaps

**After Week 2 improvements: A (Industry-Grade)** ‚≠ê

---

## üöÄ What Should You Build Next?

**My recommendation for immediate next steps:**

1. **Sentry Integration** (1 hour) - Critical for debugging production
2. **Audit Logging** (2 hours) - HIPAA compliance
3. **Session Timeout** (2 hours) - Security requirement
4. **Global Search** (3 hours) - Major UX improvement
5. **Print SOAP Notes** (2 hours) - Clinicians need this daily

**Total: 10 hours (1-2 days of work)**

These 5 improvements will take you from "MVP" to "Production-Ready" for the pilot.

## üìû Need Prioritization Help?

Let me know which features are most critical for Pequeno Cotol√™ngo, and I'll create a custom roadmap.

**Questions to consider:**
- Do clinicians use mobile devices? (‚Üí prioritize mobile responsiveness)
- Are there multiple user types? (‚Üí prioritize RBAC)
- Is network unreliable? (‚Üí prioritize offline support)
- Are there regulatory audits? (‚Üí prioritize audit logging)
