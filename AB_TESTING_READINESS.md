## 🎯 Ready for A/B Testing

### What You Can Do Now

**Immediately:**
1. ✅ Create PostHog account and get API key
2. ✅ Set up first feature flag (simple UI toggle)
3. ✅ Deploy to production with analytics
4. ✅ Invite 5-10 beta providers
5. ✅ Run first A/B test (dashboard layout)

**This Week:**
1. Complete Priority 1 accessibility fixes (skip link, modal focus, ARIA labels)
2. Set up Sentry error monitoring
3. Configure performance dashboards
4. Run staging tests
5. Launch to beta providers

**Next 2 Weeks:**
1. Run first A/B test with providers
2. Collect baseline metrics
3. Complete accessibility fixes
4. Optimize performance
5. Expand to 50+ providers

### Sample First A/B Test

**Hypothesis:** Adding a "Quick SOAP" button increases notes created per day

**Setup:**
```typescript
// 1. Create flag in PostHog: 'quick-soap-button' (50% rollout)

// 2. Add to dashboard
const showQuickSOAP = useFeatureFlag(FeatureFlags.QUICK_SOAP_BUTTON);

// 3. Track exposure
analytics.track('feature_flag_evaluated', {
  flagKey: 'quick-soap-button',
  variant: showQuickSOAP ? 'treatment' : 'control',
});

// 4. Track outcome
analytics.track('clinical_note_created', {
  variant: showQuickSOAP ? 'treatment' : 'control',
  duration: completionTime,
});

// 5. Analyze in PostHog after 2 weeks
```

**Expected Results:**
- Treatment group creates 15% more notes
- Time to create note reduced by 20%
- Ship to 100% if successful

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅

**What's Safe:**
- Analytics infrastructure (HIPAA-compliant, tested)
- Feature flags (can disable instantly)
- Rate limiting (prevents abuse)
- Documentation (comprehensive, reviewed)

### Medium Risk 🟡

**Needs Monitoring:**
- Performance (baseline not established yet)
- Accessibility (70% compliant, needs fixes)
- User adoption (new interface for providers)

**Mitigation:**
- Start with 5-10 beta providers
- Monitor closely for first 48 hours
- Have rollback plan ready
