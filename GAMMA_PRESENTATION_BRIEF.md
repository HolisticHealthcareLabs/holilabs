# 🎯 Holi Labs — Gamma Presentation Brief

> **Condensed strategy content for AI presentation generation**

---

## 1. THE HOOK (Opening Slide)

**Hero Headline:**  
> "We prevented 847 cases of diabetes. What's your AI doing?"

**30-Second Pitch:**  
> "HoliLabs is the AI platform that proves it saved your patients' lives. We don't just document care—we measure outcomes. 10,000+ doctors worth of prevention data. 10ms latency. Zero integration friction."

---

## 2. THE PROBLEM

| Status Quo | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| AI scribes document illness | They don't prevent it |
| EHR systems are reactive | Built for billing, not care |
| No outcome measurement | Can't prove "lives saved" |
| 70% physician burnout | Documentation is the #1 cause |

**Market Gap:** No one tracks **prevented outcomes**. Every competitor documents disease. We prevent it.

---

## 3. THE SOLUTION: CORTEX ASSURANCE

### Three Pillars

| Pillar | What It Does | Differentiator |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **🛡️ The Interceptor** | Edge device that reads EHR screens in real-time | Visual-only (no audio), no BAA required |
| **📊 The Console** | Cloud dashboard for governance & analytics | Enterprise visibility across 1000s of clinicians |
| **📜 The Protocol** | Deterministic safety rules (1,200+ drug checks) | 10ms latency, runs locally, works offline |

**Architecture:** Data stays on the hospital network. Only cryptographic signatures go to the cloud.

## 5. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

| Feature | Nuance DAX | Suki | Abridge | **HoliLabs** |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| AI Scribe | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Visual-Only (No Audio) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **MOAT** |
| USPSTF Prevention | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **MOAT** |
| Differential Privacy | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **MOAT** |
| EHR Integration | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ (Q2 2026) |
| Outcome Tracking | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **MOAT** |
| Price | $99-149 | $199 | $149 | **$149** |

**Why Competitors Can't Copy:**
1. **Data Moat:** 3-5 years of prevention data required
2. **The Air Gap:** We have access to hospital desktops that cloud-only giants can't reach
3. **Regulatory Moat:** Differential privacy (only 12% of healthtech has this)

## 7. REVENUE PROJECTIONS

| Quarter | Users | ARR | Viral Coefficient |
|---------|-------|-----|-------------------|
| Q1 | 100 | $178K | 0.1 |
| Q2 | 500 | $900K | 0.3 |
| Q3 | 2,000 | $3.6M | 0.4 |
| Q4 | 5,000 | $9M | 0.5 |

**Year 1 Target:** 5,000 physicians, $9M ARR

---

## 8. DEFENSIBILITY (MOATS)

### Moat #0: The "Last Mile" Defense
Cloud giants are trapped in the cloud. We have access to the air-gapped hospital desktop that Google/OpenAI can't reach.

### Moat #1: Prevention Data Flywheel
More doctors → more prevention data → better predictions → more value → more doctors

### Moat #2: Differential Privacy
PhD-level cryptography. Only 12% of healthtech has this. Required for NIH/VA partnerships.

### Moat #3: First Mover in Outcome Measurement
12-18 months of data collection = time advantage no one can buy.

## 9. KEY METRICS TO HIT

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Month-over-Month Growth | 15-50% |
| Churn Rate | <8% |
