   - Create source
   - Get token
   - Add to DigitalOcean: `LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN`

### Step 2: Verify Setup (10 min)

After deployment:

```bash
# Check monitoring status
curl https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app/api/monitoring-status

# Test PostHog
curl https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app/api/test-posthog

# Test Sentry
curl https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app/api/test-sentry
```

### Step 3: Create Feature Flags (20 min)

Follow: `FEATURE_FLAGS_GUIDE.md`

Create 6 essential flags:
1. `ai-scribe-beta`
2. `new-dashboard-layout`
3. `patient-portal-enabled`
4. `voice-recording-v2`
5. `offline-mode-enabled`
6. `advanced-analytics`

### Step 4: Build Funnels & Dashboard (30 min)

Follow: `FUNNELS_AND_DASHBOARDS_GUIDE.md`

Create:
- 5 funnels (onboarding, activation, retention, AI adoption, portal)
- 8 dashboard panels

### Step 5: Add More Event Tracking (2-3 hours)

Implement tracking for remaining events:
- AI Scribe sessions
- Prescription creation
- Appointment booking
- Document uploads
- Patient portal actions

**Template:**
```typescript
import { trackEvent, ServerAnalyticsEvents } from '@/lib/analytics/server-analytics';

// After successful action
await trackEvent(
  ServerAnalyticsEvents.PRESCRIPTION_CREATED,
  userId,
  {
    // NO PHI! Only metadata
    success: true
  }
);
```

## 🔒 HIPAA Compliance

### ✅ All Analytics are HIPAA-Compliant

**Protections in Place:**

1. **PostHog Configuration**
   - Autocapture: DISABLED
   - Session recording: DISABLED
   - Heatmaps: DISABLED
   - US Cloud hosting only

2. **PHI Sanitization**
   - `sanitizeProperties()` removes: names, emails, CPF, phone, diagnoses
   - Regex filters catch: CPF patterns, phone patterns, email patterns
   - Manual review of all event properties

3. **User Identification**
   - Use UUIDs only (never real names)
   - No email addresses in user IDs
   - Hash sensitive identifiers

4. **Audit Logging**
   - All analytics events logged
   - Audit trail for compliance

**Sensitive Fields NEVER Tracked:**
- ❌ Patient names
- ❌ CPF / SSN
- ❌ Email addresses
- ❌ Phone numbers
- ❌ Diagnoses
- ❌ Medications
- ❌ Addresses
- ❌ Medical record numbers
