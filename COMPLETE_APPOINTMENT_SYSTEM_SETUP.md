## üì¶ Services You Need (and Why)

### 1. **Resend** (Email Service) - ‚úÖ YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS
**Cost**: FREE (3,000 emails/month)
**Why**: Sends beautiful HTML emails when WhatsApp/SMS fail
**What it does**:
- Sends appointment confirmation emails
- Provides backup when patient doesn't have WhatsApp
- Professional transactional email delivery

**Status**: ‚úÖ You said you already set up Resend API key!

---

### 2. **Twilio** (WhatsApp + SMS) - ‚ö†Ô∏è YOU NEED THIS
**Cost**:
- WhatsApp Sandbox: FREE for testing
- WhatsApp Production: $0.005/message (half a cent)
- SMS: $0.02/message (2 cents)
- Total: ~$5-15/month for 1,000 patients

**Why**:
- **WhatsApp has 98% open rate** vs 20% for email
- **97% of LATAM users have WhatsApp** (vs 23% in US)
- This is your KILLER FEATURE - no competitor has this

**What it does**:
- Sends WhatsApp messages (PRIMARY channel)
- Falls back to SMS if WhatsApp unavailable
- Both use same Twilio account

**Setup Steps**:
1. Go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
2. Sign up (get $15 free credits = ~500 WhatsApp messages)
3. Get WhatsApp Sandbox access (for testing)
4. Get 3 credentials:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` (starts with AC...)
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (keep secret!)
   - `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` (format: `whatsapp:+14155238886`)

---

### 3. **Vercel Cron** OR **GitHub Actions** (Automated Scheduler) - ‚úÖ ALREADY CONFIGURED
**Cost**: FREE
**Why**: Triggers your reminder sending every night at 8 PM
**What it does**: Calls your API endpoint daily to send reminders

**Current Setup**:
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` already configured with cron job
- ‚úÖ Runs daily at 8 PM: `"0 20 * * *"`
- ‚úÖ Calls `/api/cron/send-appointment-reminders`

**Alternative** (if on DigitalOcean):
- Use GitHub Actions (see CONFIRMATION_SYSTEM_SETUP.md)
- Or use external service like cron-job.org (FREE)

---

### 4. **Calendar System** - ‚úÖ YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS IN YOUR DATABASE!
**Cost**: FREE (built-in)
**Why**: You DON'T need Google Calendar or external integration!

**How it works**:
```
Your Prisma Database (PostgreSQL)
  ‚Üì
appointments table (ALREADY EXISTS)
  ‚Üì
Stores: startTime, endTime, patient, clinician, status
  ‚Üì
Your dashboard creates appointments
  ‚Üì
Cron job reads tomorrow's appointments
  ‚Üì
Sends reminders automatically
```

**You DON'T need**:
- ‚ùå Google Calendar API
- ‚ùå Calendly
- ‚ùå Cal.com
- ‚ùå External calendar services

**You already have**:
- ‚úÖ `/dashboard/appointments` page (doctors create appointments here)
- ‚úÖ Prisma `appointment` model with all fields
- ‚úÖ API endpoints to create/update appointments
- ‚úÖ Everything stored in YOUR PostgreSQL database

---

## üîß Complete Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# ‚úÖ YOU ALREADY HAVE (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
EMAIL_FROM="Holi Labs <noreply@holilabs.com>"

# ‚ö†Ô∏è YOU NEED TO ADD (Twilio WhatsApp)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your-auth-token-here"
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER="whatsapp:+14155238886"

# ‚úÖ GENERATE THIS NOW (Cron Security)
CRON_SECRET="generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32"

# ‚úÖ YOU ALREADY HAVE
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
```

**Generate CRON_SECRET now**:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
Copy the output and add it to `.env`

---

### Step 2: Set Up Twilio WhatsApp (10 minutes)

1. **Create Twilio Account**:
   - Go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
   - Sign up with email
   - Verify phone number
   - Get $15 free credits

2. **Get WhatsApp Sandbox**:
   - Go to Twilio Console ‚Üí Messaging ‚Üí Try it Out ‚Üí Send a WhatsApp message
   - You'll see: "Send `join <code>` to `+1 415 523 8886`"
   - On YOUR phone, open WhatsApp and send that message
   - Wait for confirmation: "You are all set!"

3. **Get Credentials**:
   - Dashboard shows `Account SID` (starts with AC)
   - Click "Show" to reveal `Auth Token`
   - WhatsApp number: `whatsapp:+14155238886` (from sandbox page)

4. **Add to Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="AC123..." # From dashboard

### Step 3: How Doctors Use the System

#### Option A: Automatic Confirmations (Recommended)
**What happens**:
1. Doctor creates appointment in `/dashboard/appointments`
2. System automatically sends reminder at 8 PM the night before
3. Patient gets WhatsApp message with confirmation link
4. Patient clicks ‚Üí Confirms/Reschedules/Cancels
5. Doctor sees status update in dashboard

**No doctor action needed after creating appointment!**

#### Option B: Manual Confirmations (Optional)
**What you'd need to add**:
- Toggle in appointment creation form: "Send confirmation reminder" (ON/OFF)
- Store preference in database: `appointment.sendReminder = true/false`
- Cron job checks this flag before sending

**I can add this UI toggle if you want!**

---

### Step 4: Test the System

#### Test 1: Create Test Appointment
```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/appointments
# Click "New Appointment"
# Fill in:
#   - Patient: Select patient with phone number
#   - Date: Tomorrow
#   - Time: Any time
#   - Type: IN_PERSON or VIRTUAL
# Click "Create"
```

#### Test 2: Manually Trigger Reminder
```bash
# Generate a CRON_SECRET first
export CRON_SECRET="your-generated-secret"

# Trigger the cron job manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/send-appointment-reminders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"

# You should see:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "total": 1,
    "sent": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "message": "Sent 1 reminders, 0 failed"
}
```

#### Test 3: Check Your WhatsApp
- Open WhatsApp on your phone
- You should receive:
```
üè• *Confirma tu Cita M√©dica*

¬°Hola Maria!

Tienes una cita ma√±ana:
üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Juan P√©rez
üìÖ 15 de Octubre, 2025 - 10:00 AM

*Por favor, confirma tu asistencia:*
https://holilabs.com/confirm/abc123

‚úÖ Confirmar
üìÖ Reagendar
‚ùå Cancelar

```

#### Test 4: Click Confirmation Link
- Click the link in WhatsApp
- Should open beautiful gradient confirmation page
- Click "Confirmar"
- Check dashboard - status should update to "CONFIRMED"

---

## üé® Reschedule Feature - How It Works

**Current Setup**:
- Confirmation page has 3 buttons: Confirm, Reschedule, Cancel
- "Reschedule" currently just marks appointment as "RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED"
- Doctor sees this status and contacts patient manually

**Option 1: Build Custom Calendar Picker** (Recommended)
**What you'd get**:
- Patient clicks "Reschedule"
- Opens calendar showing doctor's available slots
- Patient picks new time
- Doctor approves/rejects reschedule request

**I can build this! Would take:**
- Calendar UI component (react-big-calendar or FullCalendar)
- API to fetch doctor's availability
- Reschedule request approval flow
- ~2-3 hours of work

**Option 2: Use External Service** (Quick but costs money)
- Calendly ($10-15/month)
- Cal.com (FREE, self-hosted)
- Integrate their iframe into reschedule page

**Option 3: Simple Time Picker** (Fastest)
- Patient picks any date/time they want
- Doctor approves later
- No availability checking

**Which do you prefer?** I recommend Option 1 (custom) since you already have the database.

        run: |
          curl -X POST https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app/api/cron/send-appointment-reminders \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}"
```

Add `CRON_SECRET` to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets.

**Option B: External Cron Service** (Easiest)
1. Go to https://cron-job.org (FREE)
2. Create account
3. Add job:
   - URL: `https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app/api/cron/send-appointment-reminders`

## üìû Questions?

**Q: Do I need Google Calendar?**
A: NO! You have appointments in your database already. That's your "calendar."

**Q: Do I need Calendly or Cal.com?**
A: NO! Unless you want external scheduling. Your dashboard already creates appointments.

**Q: What if patient wants to reschedule?**
A: Currently marks as "RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED" ‚Üí doctor calls them. I can build automatic reschedule picker if you want!

**Q: Can doctors turn off auto-confirmations?**
A: Not yet, but I can add a toggle in 15 minutes. Want me to?

**Q: What about SMS?**
A: Same Twilio account! But WhatsApp is cheaper ($0.005 vs $0.02) and has higher open rates.
