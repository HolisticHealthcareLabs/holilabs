## üõ°Ô∏è Technical Safeguards While Awaiting BAAs

### Data Minimization

Until BAAs are signed, use **synthetic test data only**:

```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER do this before BAAs signed
const patient = {
  firstName: 'Juan',
  lastName: 'Garc√≠a',
  cpf: '123.456.789-00',
  diagnosis: 'Hypertension'
};

// ‚úÖ Use synthetic data
const patient = {
  firstName: 'Test',
  lastName: 'Patient',
  cpf: '000.000.000-00',
  diagnosis: '[TEST DATA ONLY]'
};
```

### Environment Labels

Add warning banners to staging environments:

```tsx
// Add to layout.tsx for staging
{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV === 'staging' && (
  <div className="bg-red-600 text-white text-center py-2 text-sm font-bold">
    ‚ö†Ô∏è STAGING ENVIRONMENT - DO NOT USE REAL PATIENT DATA - NO BAAs SIGNED ‚ö†Ô∏è
  </div>
)}
```

### Sentry Data Scrubbing

Configure Sentry to NEVER log PHI:

```typescript
// sentry.config.ts
Sentry.init({
  beforeSend(event, hint) {
    // Remove potential PHI from error messages
    if (event.message) {
      event.message = event.message.replace(/\b\d{3}\.\d{3}\.\d{3}-\d{2}\b/g, '[CPF_REDACTED]');
      event.message = event.message.replace(/\b[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+\b/g, '[EMAIL_REDACTED]');
    }

    // Remove PHI from breadcrumbs
    if (event.breadcrumbs) {
      event.breadcrumbs = event.breadcrumbs.map(crumb => ({
        ...crumb,
        data: undefined, // Remove all breadcrumb data to be safe
      }));
    }

    return event;
  },
});
```

## üö® What If Vendor Doesn't Offer BAA?

### Option 1: Find Alternative Vendor

**Email Service Example:**
- ‚ùå Resend (no BAA as of Jan 2025)
- ‚úÖ SendGrid (HIPAA BAA available)
- ‚úÖ Amazon SES (BAA included with AWS account)

### Option 2: De-identify Data

If vendor refuses BAA, ensure NO PHI is shared:

```typescript
// Example: Sending email without PHI
const emailData = {
  to: patient.email, // ‚ùå This IS PHI
  subject: 'Appointment Reminder',
  body: `Hello ${patient.firstName}`, // ‚ùå This IS PHI
};

// ‚úÖ De-identified version
const emailData = {
  to: patient.email, // Still sent, but...
  subject: 'Appointment Reminder',
  body: 'Hello! You have an upcoming appointment.', // No name
  // Use secure patient portal link instead of including details
  link: `https://app.holilabs.com/portal/${hashedPatientId}`,
};
```

### Option 3: Self-Host Alternative

If vendor is critical but no BAA available, consider:
- **Email:** Self-host Postal or Mailu
- **Analytics:** Self-host Plausible or Matomo
- **File Storage:** Keep everything in Supabase (BAA available)
