## 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Production

### 🔐 1. Security & Secrets (Priority: P0)

**Current Issues**:
```bash
# ❌ EXPOSED API KEYS IN .env.local (CRITICAL!)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_SEBRpWwx_PVp8TJ5NY6GSbaXrhi8dXwhJ
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=7c91616a78b2492ab808c14b6f0a9600
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSyCy7CTGP0Wp0zaYHrd2pmhGpt2AknsVIM8

# ❌ WEAK ENCRYPTION KEYS
DEID_SECRET=holi-labs-deid-secret-2025-change-in-production
ENCRYPTION_KEY=35dc93c7c757e122347e6e08b1b760e52313f70eff0cec873de5166d5be4aed1

# ❌ MISSING CRITICAL KEYS
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-here  # Still placeholder!
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here  # Still placeholder!
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] **URGENT**: Rotate ALL API keys immediately
- [ ] Generate production-grade secrets:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32  # For NEXTAUTH_SECRET
  openssl rand -hex 32     # For ENCRYPTION_KEY
  openssl rand -base64 64  # For DEID_SECRET
  ```
- [ ] Move secrets to **DigitalOcean App Platform Environment Variables**
- [ ] Add `.env.production.template` with placeholders only
- [ ] Revoke and regenerate all exposed API keys (AssemblyAI, Google AI, Resend)
- [ ] Enable **key rotation policy** (every 90 days)

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

---

### 🔒 2. HIPAA Compliance (Priority: P0)

**Current Status**: 🟡 Partially compliant

**What's Working**:
- ✅ Audio encryption before Supabase upload
- ✅ PHI de-identification with hash generation
- ✅ Audit logging for all patient data access
- ✅ Signed URLs with expiration (24h)

**Critical Gaps**:
- [ ] **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** with all vendors:
  - [ ] Supabase BAA (available on Pro plan - $25/mo)
  - [ ] AssemblyAI BAA (Enterprise required)
  - [ ] Google Cloud BAA (contact sales)
  - [ ] DigitalOcean BAA (verify availability)
  - [ ] Resend BAA (for PHI in emails)

- [ ] **Data Residency**:
  - [ ] Configure Supabase region (must be US for HIPAA)
  - [ ] Set DigitalOcean region to `nyc` (already in app.yaml ✅)
  - [ ] Document data flow diagram

- [ ] **Encryption at Rest**:
  - [ ] Enable PostgreSQL encryption on DigitalOcean
  - [ ] Configure Supabase storage encryption (verify enabled)
  - [ ] Document encryption methods (AES-256-GCM)

- [ ] **Access Controls**:
  - [ ] Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - [ ] Add MFA requirement for all clinician accounts
  - [ ] Create "break glass" emergency access procedure

- [ ] **Breach Notification**:
  - [ ] Implement breach detection system

  - [ ] Set up **New Relic** or **Datadog** APM
  - [ ] Add custom metrics (transcription time, note generation time)

- [ ] **Alerts**:
  - [ ] Database connection failures
  - [ ] API error rate > 5%
  - [ ] Transcription failures
  - [ ] Storage quota warnings
  - [ ] SSL certificate expiration

- [ ] **Health Checks**:
  - [ ] `/api/health` is implemented ✅
  - [ ] Add database connection check
  - [ ] Add Supabase connectivity check
  - [ ] Add AssemblyAI API check

3. **Testing prevents disasters**: 2 weeks of testing saves months of firefighting
4. **Monitoring is insurance**: Set up before you need it
5. **Documentation is key**: Future you will thank present you

**Current Grade**: B+ (70% ready)
