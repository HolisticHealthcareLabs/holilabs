### AI Development Tools

1. **Claude Code vs Cursor vs Codex** 🔴
   - Claude Code is the best product for coding agents, Codex is the best model, and Google's Anti-Gravity is the new competitor targeting Cursor

2. **Tool Selection Strategy** 🔴
   - Don't build habits on any single AI coding tool. Practice switching between Claude Code, Codex, and Anti-Gravity to remain flexible

3. **Google's Competitive Strategy** 🟡
   - Google is targeting Cursor with Anti-Gravity rather than Claude Code and Codex directly, aiming for both consumers and developers

4. **Google's Competitive Advantage** 🟡
   - Google made $110 billion this year, has TPUs (doesn't need Nvidia GPUs), and has a legion of ML programmers - positioned to dominate

5. **Open Source Alternative - OpenCode** 🟢
   - OpenCode is the open-source version that allows plugging in Chinese models, offering more programmability for advanced users

### Product Development

1. **Mobile-First Design Philosophy** 🔴
   - It's easier to switch from mobile to desktop than desktop to mobile due to screen real estate constraints. Start with mobile as a forcing function

2. **Deployment Workflow Best Practice** 🟡
   - The proper workflow is: make all edits locally, test them, then deploy to production (e.g., Digital Ocean)

3. **Screen Real Estate Concept** 🟢
   - Digital real estate refers to the limited space on screens, especially mobile. Designing for smaller screens forces better prioritization

4. **UI/UX Design - Psychological Effects** 🟢
