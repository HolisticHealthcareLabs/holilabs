## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "I don't trust AI with my patient notes"
**Response**: You're right to be cautious. That's why every AI-generated note is editable before saving, includes confidence scores for each section, and requires your review and digital signature. AI drafts—you approve. You stay in control. Plus, 95-98% accuracy means less editing than with a human medical assistant.

### "My patients are older and don't use technology"
**Response**: Neither does WhatsApp require any tech-savviness—they already use it to talk to family. One tap confirms appointment. No app download, no portal login. Plus, you can still print prescriptions and forms for patients who need paper.

### "I tried [US competitor] and the Spanish was terrible"
**Response**: Because they translated English AI. Our AI was trained on native Spanish and Portuguese medical conversations. It understands regional dialects, medical slang, and cultural context. Try the free tier—you'll hear the difference immediately.

### "What if my internet goes down?"
**Response**: That's exactly why we built offline-first. Record consultations locally, generate notes, write prescriptions—all works offline. When internet returns, everything syncs automatically. We built this for LATAM realities, not Silicon Valley assumptions.

### "I can't afford to switch systems"
**Response**: You can't afford NOT to. Start with just the AI scribe (free for 20 patients/month). Keep your existing system. When you see the time savings, migrate gradually. No rip-and-replace required. Plus, at $25/month, you recover the cost preventing just ONE no-show.

### "My practice is too small for this"
**Response**: Perfect—you're exactly who we built this for. Free forever for 20 patients/month. Solo practitioners deserve enterprise tools without enterprise prices. Start free, upgrade only when you grow.

### "I don't have time to learn new software"
**Response**: 48-hour deployment. Most doctors are fully trained in under 2 hours. If you can use WhatsApp, you can use Holi Labs. Plus, we'll do a free onboarding call—we'll train your whole team.
