# Production Deployment Checklist

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Version:** v1.0.0 - Security Hardened Release
**Deployment Target:** DigitalOcean App Platform

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Security Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)

All of these must be set in DigitalOcean App Platform **before** deployment:

```bash
# Database (Required)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require

# Encryption (CRITICAL - HIPAA Required)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generate with: openssl rand -hex 32>
# IMPORTANT: Use a different key than development!
# NEVER commit this key to Git

# AI Provider APIs (Required for functionality)
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your-assemblyai-api-key
# Required for: Audio transcription (Portuguese/Spanish support)
# Cost: ~$0.015/min (~50% cheaper than Whisper)
# Sign up: https://www.assemblyai.com/

GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-google-ai-api-key
# Required for: SOAP note generation (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
# Cost: ~$0.003/note (~35x cheaper than Claude)
# Sign up: https://ai.google.dev/

# Supabase (Required for file storage)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...
# Note: Service role key needed for server-side storage access

# Next.js (Required)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<generate with: openssl rand -base64 32>

# Optional: Connection pool tuning
DB_POOL_SIZE=10
DB_TIMEOUT=10000
DB_QUERY_TIMEOUT=15000
DB_POOL_TIMEOUT=10000
```

**Verification Command:**
```bash
# Test encryption key format (must be 64 hex characters)
echo -n "$ENCRYPTION_KEY" | wc -c  # Should output: 64
```

---

### 2. Supabase Storage Configuration (CRITICAL)

**Bucket: `medical-recordings`**

1. **Create bucket if not exists:**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
   VALUES ('medical-recordings', 'medical-recordings', false);
   ```

2. **Set bucket to PRIVATE (not public):**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí medical-recordings
   - Ensure "Public bucket" is **OFF**
   - Files should only be accessible via signed URLs

3. **Configure RLS Policies:**
   ```sql
   -- Allow authenticated service role to upload/download
   CREATE POLICY "Service role can upload medical recordings"
   ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
   TO service_role
   WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'medical-recordings');

   CREATE POLICY "Service role can download medical recordings"
   ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
   TO service_role
   USING (bucket_id = 'medical-recordings');

   -- Prevent public access
   CREATE POLICY "No public access to medical recordings"
   ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
   TO anon
   USING (false);
   ```

4. **Verify:**
   - Try accessing a file URL without authentication ‚Üí Should return 403/401
   - Signed URLs should work for 24 hours

---

### 3. Database Schema Migration

**Ensure Prisma migrations are applied:**

```bash
# From your local machine (with DATABASE_URL pointing to production)
pnpm prisma migrate deploy

# Verify all tables exist
pnpm prisma db pull
```

**Expected tables:**
- users
- patients
- scribe_sessions
- transcriptions
- soap_notes
- medications
- prescriptions
- consents
- appointments
- documents
- clinical_notes
- audit_logs
- blockchain_transactions

---

### 4. PHI Encryption Verification

**Important:** Existing patient data will be automatically encrypted on first access.

**Migration Strategy:**
1. On first patient read ‚Üí Data is returned unencrypted (legacy)
2. On first patient update ‚Üí Data is encrypted and stored
3. No manual migration script needed

**Test Encryption:**
```bash
# After deployment, check database directly
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT \"firstName\", \"lastName\" FROM patients LIMIT 1;"

# Should see base64 strings like: "iY3R5cA==:dGVzdA==:ZW5jcnlwdGVk"
# NOT plain text names
```

---

### 5. API Key Security Audit

**Before deployment, verify:**

- [ ] No API keys hardcoded in source code
- [ ] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (verified ‚úÖ)
- [ ] No API keys in Git history (run: `git log -p | grep -i "sk-"`)
- [ ] API keys use least privilege (read-only where possible)
- [ ] API keys have rate limits configured

---

## üîí HIPAA Compliance Verification

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-flight Checks

```bash
# 1. Run tests (if available)
pnpm test

# 2. Build locally to verify
pnpm build

# 3. Check for security issues
pnpm audit --production

# 4. Verify environment variables are NOT in code
grep -r "sk-ant" src/  # Should return nothing
grep -r "sk-proj" src/  # Should return nothing
```

### Step 2: Deploy to DigitalOcean

```bash
# Option A: Automatic deployment (GitHub integration)
git push origin main
# DigitalOcean will auto-deploy on push

# Option B: Manual deployment via CLI
doctl apps create --spec .do/app.yaml
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification

**1. Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
```

**2. Database Connection:**
```bash
curl https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app/api/patients
# Should require authentication (401 Unauthorized)
```

**3. Test Patient Creation (Encryption):**
```bash
# Create test patient via API
curl -X POST https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app/api/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"Patient","dateOfBirth":"1990-01-01"}'

# Check database - firstName/lastName should be encrypted
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT \"firstName\" FROM patients ORDER BY \"createdAt\" DESC LIMIT 1;"
# Should see: "iY3R5cA==:dGVzdA==:..." NOT "Test"
```

**4. Test Audio Upload (Encryption):**
- Upload a test audio file via Scribe interface
- Check Supabase Storage ‚Üí Bucket should show `.encrypted` extension
- Try accessing file URL directly ‚Üí Should fail (403)
- Check signed URL ‚Üí Should work

**5. Test Whisper Transcription:**
- Upload audio and finalize session
- Check logs for: "Transcription completed in XXXms"
- Verify SOAP note was generated

**6. Test Audit Logging:**
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_logs WHERE \"createdAt\" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';"
# Should show recent activity
```
