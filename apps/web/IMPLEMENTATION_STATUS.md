## 📊 Architecture Decision Log

| Decision | Rationale | Trade-offs |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Prisma over raw SQL** | Type safety, migrations | Learning curve |
| **Hybrid Supabase + Prisma** | Best of both worlds | More complexity |
| **Blockchain-ready from day 1** | Easy pivot later | Extra fields now |
| **Next.js App Router** | Modern, server components | Breaking changes |
| **Spanish-first UI** | LATAM market focus | Need i18n later |
