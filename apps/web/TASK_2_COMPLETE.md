## ⚠️ Important Production Notes

### HIPAA Compliance

**Before deploying to production, you MUST:**

1. **AssemblyAI**
   - Sign up for Enterprise plan
   - Request BAA from: https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/security-and-compliance/hipaa
   - Wait for BAA approval

2. **Google Cloud (Gemini)**
   - **DO NOT use AI Studio API** (not HIPAA-compliant)
   - **Must use Vertex AI** for BAA
   - Contact Google Cloud sales for BAA
   - Follow: https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/hipaa-compliance

3. **Update Code for Vertex AI**
   - Current code uses AI Studio (for development)
   - For production, replace with Vertex AI SDK:
   ```typescript
   // Development (AI Studio - NOT HIPAA)
   import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai';

   // Production (Vertex AI - HIPAA-compliant)
   import { VertexAI } from '@google-cloud/vertexai';
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Create AssemblyAI account at https://www.assemblyai.com/
2. ✅ Create Google AI account at https://ai.google.dev/
3. ✅ Add API keys to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
4. ✅ Test transcription with sample audio

### This Week
1. Record sample Portuguese and Spanish consultations
2. Test end-to-end flow (upload → transcribe → SOAP note)
3. Verify speaker diarization accuracy
4. Verify PHI redaction working

### Before Production
1. Sign BAAs with AssemblyAI (Enterprise plan)
2. Migrate to Vertex AI (instead of AI Studio)
3. Sign BAA with Google Cloud
4. Test with real doctor consultations
5. Load test at scale (100+ concurrent users)
