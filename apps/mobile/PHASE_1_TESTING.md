## 📱 How to Test on Your Phone

### Step 1: Install Expo Go

**iOS (iPhone/iPad):**

### Step 2: Check Your Terminal

Look at the terminal window where you ran `pnpm start`. You should see:

› Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)

▌ [QR CODE]

› Press a │ open Android

```

**If you don't see the QR code yet**, wait 30-60 seconds for Metro bundler to fully start.

### Step 3: Scan the QR Code

1. Open the **Camera** app (not Expo Go)
2. Point camera at QR code in terminal
3. Tap the notification banner that appears
4. App will open in Expo Go

## 🎯 What to Test (Step-by-Step)

### Test 1: Login Screen ✅

**What you'll see:**
- "Holi Labs" title in Navy blue (#0A3758)
- "AI Medical Scribe" subtitle
- Email and password inputs
- "Sign In" button (Blue #428CD4)
- "Create Account" button (ghost style)
- Demo credentials text at bottom

**What to try:**
1. ✅ Look at the design - does it match your branding?
2. ✅ Type in the email field - keyboard should appear
3. ✅ Tap the password visibility icon (eye) - password shows/hides
4. ✅ Try to login (it will fail, that's expected - no backend yet)
5. ✅ Tap "Create Account" - should navigate to Register screen

**Expected Behavior:**
- ❌ Login will show "Login Failed" alert (normal - backend not connected)
- ✅ UI should be smooth and responsive
- ✅ Colors should match VidaBanq branding

---

### Test 2: Register Screen ✅

**What you'll see:**
- "Create Account" title
- Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password fields
- "Create Account" button
- "Already have an account? Sign In" button

**What to try:**
1. ✅ Fill in all fields
2. ✅ Try mismatched passwords - should show error
3. ✅ Try short password - should show error
4. ✅ Leave fields empty and submit - should show error
5. ✅ Go back to Login screen

**Expected Behavior:**
- ❌ Registration will fail (normal - backend not connected)
- ✅ Validation should work (password matching, required fields)
- ✅ Error messages should be clear

---

### Test 3: Navigation (Bypass Login)

Since login requires backend, you can bypass it for testing:

**Option A: Temporary Bypass (I can add this if you want)**
Comment out authentication check to skip directly to main app

**Option B: Test Login UI Only**
Just test the login screen design and move to next phase

**For now, focus on Login/Register UI testing.**

---

### Test 4: Theme Toggle ✅

**What to try:**
1. ✅ Observe current theme (light by default)
2. ✅ Change device system theme (Settings > Display > Dark Mode)
3. ✅ App should respond if theme is set to "auto"

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Colors change instantly
- ✅ All screens adapt to theme
- ✅ Text remains readable in both modes
