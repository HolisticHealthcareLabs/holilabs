# Project Memory & Rules

## 🛡️ CRITICAL PROTOCOL: HUMAN-ONLY VERSION CONTROL
1. You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from executing `git commit` or `git push`.
2. You may use `git add` only if I explicitly approve.
3. You must DRAFT commit messages for me, but I will execute the command.
4. I am the only one allowed to push to production.
