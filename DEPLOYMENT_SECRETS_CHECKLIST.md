## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Deployment Fails

**Symptoms:**
- App shows "Deployment Failed" status
- Red X in Activity tab

**Solution:**
1. Go to: Apps ‚Üí holilabs-lwp6y ‚Üí Runtime Logs
2. Look for error messages mentioning environment variables
3. Common issues:
   - Typo in variable name
   - Missing required variable
   - Invalid value format (e.g., DATABASE_URL format incorrect)
4. Fix the issue and save again (will trigger redeployment)

### Issue 2: Database Connection Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Health check returns `"database": false`
- Errors in logs: "connection refused" or "authentication failed"

**Solution:**
1. Verify DATABASE_URL format:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
   ```
2. Check that `?sslmode=require` is included
3. Verify database credentials are correct
4. Check database is running in DigitalOcean

### Issue 3: Authentication Doesn't Work

**Symptoms:**
- Can't log in
- Sessions immediately expire
- "Invalid session" errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify SESSION_SECRET is set and marked as ENCRYPTED
2. Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set and marked as ENCRYPTED
3. Verify NEXTAUTH_URL matches your actual app URL
4. Clear browser cookies and try again

### Issue 4: Supabase Features Don't Work

**Symptoms:**
- File uploads fail
- Auth features broken
- "Unauthorized" errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify all 3 Supabase variables are set:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
2. Check that SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is marked as ENCRYPTED
3. Verify keys are correct in Supabase dashboard

### Issue 5: AI Features Don't Work

**Symptoms:**
- AI scribe doesn't respond
- "API key invalid" errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set and marked as ENCRYPTED
2. Check that key is valid in Anthropic console
3. Check API usage limits haven't been exceeded

  - Add calendar reminder for 180 days (encryption key)

- [ ] **4. Document in password manager**
  - Save all secrets in 1Password/LastPass
  - Add secret rotation dates
  - Add recovery instructions

- [ ] **5. Delete sensitive files**
  - [ ] Delete `PRODUCTION_SECRETS_GENERATED.md`
  - [ ] Or remove all actual secret values from file

- [ ] **6. Update documentation**
