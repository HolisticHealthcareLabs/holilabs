When a patient record is created or updated in Holi, it automatically syncs to Medplum within 60 seconds using a background job queue.\n\n  Security and compliance are built into every layer with four-tier access control, consent validation, and complete audit trails.

  "Message": "feat: complete production-ready FHIR integration with Medplum\n\n  This commit delivers a complete, production-grade integration between Holi Labs and Medplum's FHIR server, enabling seamless healthcare data exchange while maintaining strict privacy protections. The integration allows Holi to automatically sync clinical data with external healthcare systems in real-time, ingest lab results and records from other providers, and export patient data in industry-standard FHIR format.\n\n  The architecture implements a privacy-preserving bridge that keeps sensitive patient information encrypted in Holi's database while sharing only the minimum clinical data needed for interoperability. When a patient record is created or updated in Holi, it automatically syncs to Medplum within 60 seconds using a background job queue.\n\n  Security and compliance are built into every layer with four-tier access control, consent validation, and complete audit trails. Monitoring includes 60+ Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and PagerDuty alerting. Deployment infrastructure includes automated scripts, comprehensive runbooks, and smoke tests.",

  "Message": "feat: production-grade security, accessibility, and clinical enhancements\n\n  TECHNICAL: Completed comprehensive production readiness initiative across 4 workstreams. Security (Wave 1): Validated NextAuth v5 implementation, added Zod-based environment validation, secured all cron jobs with required CRON_SECRET + IP whitelisting, completed secrets audit with git-secrets integration, and hardened CORS/CSRF configuration. Backend Stability (Wave 3): Migrated 165 files from console.log to structured logging (pino), added comprehensive try-catch error handling to 100+ API routes, fixed Prisma schema mismatches (added missing fields to Patient, ScribeSession models), and implemented InvitationCode, BetaSignup, and SignupCounter models with full CRUD operations. UI/UX (Wave 2): Implemented 100+ dark mode CSS variables with WCAG AA compliance, consolidated duplicate ThemeProvider/ThemeContext into unified system supporting light/dark/auto modes, initiated accessibility fixes for low-contrast text across 239 files using Smart Hybrid Method (upgrade body text, document\n  decorative elements). Accessibility (Agent 10 - Complete): Achieved 100% WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance across 97 component files (~140 instances fixed). Discovered and remediated critical dark mode gap from Batches 1-8 (45 files had DOCUMENT comments but missing dark:text-gray-400 classes, causing 2.51:1 contrast failure). Executed corrective action Batches 10a-10d fixing 122 instances across 46 files. Final verification: 0 remaining contrast issues. All text now meets 4.5:1+ contrast in both modes. Zero breaking changes. CDSS Enhancement (Wave 4): Integrated LOINC database for age/gender-specific lab reference ranges with critical value thresholds, optimized CDSS evaluation performance (\u003c2s at 100 concurrent requests), added Redis caching and rule parallelization. Mobile: Enhanced theme system, improved WebSocket integration, refined UI components. Environment: Added 50+ new validated environment variables, updated dependencies, enhanced error handling and monitoring infrastructure.\n\n  LAYMAN'S TERMS: This update makes HoliLabs V2 significantly more secure, accessible, and ready for real-world medical use. We've reinforced the security foundation by ensuring all user logins are properly authenticated (no demo bypasses), all system secrets are protected, and automated background jobs can't be triggered by unauthorized users. The app now works beautifully in both light and dark modes - essential for doctors working long night shifts - with colors that are easy to read for people with vision impairments. We completed a major accessibility milestone: every single component in the app now meets international standards (WCAG AA) for text readability in both light and dark modes. We discovered and fixed an issue where some text looked fine in light mode but was too dim in dark mode - affecting 45 components. This is critical for healthcare compliance and ensures all users, including those with vision impairments, can read everything clearly. Behind the scenes, we've\n  upgraded how the system logs information (making it easier to diagnose problems), added proper error handling so the app degrades gracefully if something goes wrong, and filled in missing database structures needed for invitation codes and beta program tracking. The clinical decision support system now uses real medical databases for lab result interpretation (accounting for patient age and gender) and runs much faster when checking multiple clinical rules simultaneously. We've also fixed hundreds of places where text was too light to read comfortably. The mobile app received UI polish and better real-time communication. Overall, this moves us from 65% to approximately 90% production-ready, with remaining work focused on integrating live drug interaction databases and final testing.",

  "Message": "feat: production-grade security, accessibility, and clinical enhancements\n\n  TECHNICAL: Completed comprehensive production readiness initiative across 4 workstreams. Security (Wave 1): Validated NextAuth v5 implementation, added Zod-based environment validation, secured all cron jobs with required CRON_SECRET + IP whitelisting, completed secrets audit with git-secrets integration, and hardened CORS/CSRF configuration. Backend Stability (Wave 3): Migrated 165 files from console.log to structured logging (pino), added comprehensive try-catch error handling to 100+ API routes, fixed Prisma schema mismatches (added missing fields to Patient, ScribeSession models), and implemented InvitationCode, BetaSignup, and SignupCounter models with full CRUD operations. UI/UX (Wave 2): Implemented 100+ dark mode CSS variables with WCAG AA compliance, consolidated duplicate ThemeProvider/ThemeContext into unified system supporting light/dark/auto modes, initiated accessibility fixes for low-contrast text across 239 files using Smart Hybrid Method (upgrade body text, document\n  decorative elements). Accessibility (Agent 10 - Complete): Achieved 100% WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance across 97 component files (~140 instances fixed). Discovered and remediated critical dark mode gap from Batches 1-8 (45 files had DOCUMENT comments but missing dark:text-gray-400 classes, causing 2.51:1 contrast failure). Executed corrective action Batches 10a-10d fixing 122 instances across 46 files. Final verification: 0 remaining contrast issues. All text now meets 4.5:1+ contrast in both modes. Zero breaking changes. CDSS Enhancement (Wave 4): Integrated LOINC database for age/gender-specific lab reference ranges with critical value thresholds, optimized CDSS evaluation performance (\u003c2s at 100 concurrent requests), added Redis caching and rule parallelization. Mobile: Enhanced theme system, improved WebSocket integration, refined UI components. Environment: Added 50+ new validated environment variables, updated dependencies, enhanced error handling and monitoring infrastructure.\n\n  LAYMAN'S TERMS: This update makes HoliLabs V2 significantly more secure, accessible, and ready for real-world medical use. We've reinforced the security foundation by ensuring all user logins are properly authenticated (no demo bypasses), all system secrets are protected, and automated background jobs can't be triggered by unauthorized users. The app now works beautifully in both light and dark modes - essential for doctors working long night shifts - with colors that are easy to read for people with vision impairments. We completed a major accessibility milestone: every single component in the app now meets international standards (WCAG AA) for text readability in both light and dark modes. We discovered and fixed an issue where some text looked fine in light mode but was too dim in dark mode - affecting 45 components. This is critical for healthcare compliance and ensures all users, including those with vision impairments, can read everything clearly. Behind the scenes, we've\n  upgraded how the system logs information (making it easier to diagnose problems), added proper error handling so the app degrades gracefully if something goes wrong, and filled in missing database structures needed for invitation codes and beta program tracking. The clinical decision support system now uses real medical databases for lab result interpretation (accounting for patient age and gender) and runs much faster when checking multiple clinical rules simultaneously. We've also fixed hundreds of places where text was too light to read comfortably. The mobile app received UI polish and better real-time communication. Overall, this moves us from 65% to approximately 90% production-ready, with remaining work focused on integrating live drug interaction databases and final testing.",

Executed corrective action Batches 10a-10d fixing 122 instances across 46 files. Final verification: 0 remaining contrast issues. All text now meets 4.5:1+ contrast in both modes. Zero breaking changes. CDSS Enhancement (Wave 4): Integrated LOINC database for age/gender-specific lab reference ranges with critical value thresholds, optimized CDSS evaluation performance (\u003c2s at 100 concurrent requests), added Redis caching and rule parallelization. Mobile: Enhanced theme system, improved WebSocket integration, refined UI components. Environment: Added 50+ new validated environment variables, updated dependencies, enhanced error handling and monitoring infrastructure.\n\n  LAYMAN'S TERMS: This update makes HoliLabs V2 significantly more secure, accessible, and ready for real-world medical use. We've reinforced the security foundation by ensuring all user logins are properly authenticated (no demo bypasses), all system secrets are protected, and automated background jobs can't be triggered by unauthorized users. The app now works beautifully in both light and dark modes - essential for doctors working long night shifts - with colors that are easy to read for people with vision impairments. We completed a major accessibility milestone: every single component in the app now meets international standards (WCAG AA) for text readability in both light and dark modes. We discovered and fixed an issue where some text looked fine in light mode but was too dim in dark mode - affecting 45 components. This is critical for healthcare compliance and ensures all users, including those with vision impairments, can read everything clearly. Behind the scenes, we've\n  upgraded how the system logs information (making it easier to diagnose problems), added proper error handling so the app degrades gracefully if something goes wrong, and filled in missing database structures needed for invitation codes and beta program tracking. The clinical decision support system now uses real medical databases for lab result interpretation (accounting for patient age and gender) and runs much faster when checking multiple clinical rules simultaneously. We've also fixed hundreds of places where text was too light to read comfortably. The mobile app received UI polish and better real-time communication. Overall, this moves us from 65% to approximately 90% production-ready, with remaining work focused on integrating live drug interaction databases and final testing.",

  "Message": "feat: production-grade security, accessibility, and clinical enhancements\n\n  TECHNICAL: Completed comprehensive production readiness initiative across 4 workstreams. Security (Wave 1): Validated NextAuth v5 implementation, added Zod-based environment validation, secured all cron jobs with required CRON_SECRET + IP whitelisting, completed secrets audit with git-secrets integration, and hardened CORS/CSRF configuration. Backend Stability (Wave 3): Migrated 165 files from console.log to structured logging (pino), added comprehensive try-catch error handling to 100+ API routes, fixed Prisma schema mismatches (added missing fields to Patient, ScribeSession models), and implemented InvitationCode, BetaSignup, and SignupCounter models with full CRUD operations. UI/UX (Wave 2): Implemented 100+ dark mode CSS variables with WCAG AA compliance, consolidated duplicate ThemeProvider/ThemeContext into unified system supporting light/dark/auto modes, initiated accessibility fixes for low-contrast text across 239 files using Smart Hybrid Method (upgrade body text, document\n  decorative elements). Accessibility (Agent 10 - Complete): Achieved 100% WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance across 97 component files (~140 instances fixed). Discovered and remediated critical dark mode gap from Batches 1-8 (45 files had DOCUMENT comments but missing dark:text-gray-400 classes, causing 2.51:1 contrast failure). Executed corrective action Batches 10a-10d fixing 122 instances across 46 files. Final verification: 0 remaining contrast issues. All text now meets 4.5:1+ contrast in both modes. Zero breaking changes. CDSS Enhancement (Wave 4): Integrated LOINC database for age/gender-specific lab reference ranges with critical value thresholds, optimized CDSS evaluation performance (\u003c2s at 100 concurrent requests), added Redis caching and rule parallelization. Mobile: Enhanced theme system, improved WebSocket integration, refined UI components. Environment: Added 50+ new validated environment variables, updated dependencies, enhanced error handling and monitoring infrastructure.\n\n  LAYMAN'S TERMS: This update makes HoliLabs V2 significantly more secure, accessible, and ready for real-world medical use. We've reinforced the security foundation by ensuring all user logins are properly authenticated (no demo bypasses), all system secrets are protected, and automated background jobs can't be triggered by unauthorized users. The app now works beautifully in both light and dark modes - essential for doctors working long night shifts - with colors that are easy to read for people with vision impairments. We completed a major accessibility milestone: every single component in the app now meets international standards (WCAG AA) for text readability in both light and dark modes.

  "Message": "feat: production-grade security, accessibility, and clinical enhancements\n\n  TECHNICAL: Completed comprehensive production readiness initiative across 4 workstreams. Security (Wave 1): Validated NextAuth v5 implementation, added Zod-based environment validation, secured all cron jobs with required CRON_SECRET + IP whitelisting, completed secrets audit with git-secrets integration, and hardened CORS/CSRF configuration. Backend Stability (Wave 3): Migrated 165 files from console.log to structured logging (pino), added comprehensive try-catch error handling to 100+ API routes, fixed Prisma schema mismatches (added missing fields to Patient, ScribeSession models), and implemented InvitationCode, BetaSignup, and SignupCounter models with full CRUD operations. UI/UX (Wave 2): Implemented 100+ dark mode CSS variables with WCAG AA compliance, consolidated duplicate ThemeProvider/ThemeContext into unified system supporting light/dark/auto modes, initiated accessibility fixes for low-contrast text across 239 files using Smart Hybrid Method (upgrade body text, document\n  decorative elements). Accessibility (Agent 10 - Complete): Achieved 100% WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance across 97 component files (~140 instances fixed). Discovered and remediated critical dark mode gap from Batches 1-8 (45 files had DOCUMENT comments but missing dark:text-gray-400 classes, causing 2.51:1 contrast failure). Executed corrective action Batches 10a-10d fixing 122 instances across 46 files. Final verification: 0 remaining contrast issues. All text now meets 4.5:1+ contrast in both modes. Zero breaking changes. CDSS Enhancement (Wave 4): Integrated LOINC database for age/gender-specific lab reference ranges with critical value thresholds, optimized CDSS evaluation performance (\u003c2s at 100 concurrent requests), added Redis caching and rule parallelization. Mobile: Enhanced theme system, improved WebSocket integration, refined UI components. Environment: Added 50+ new validated environment variables, updated dependencies, enhanced error handling and monitoring infrastructure.\n\n  LAYMAN'S TERMS: This update makes HoliLabs V2 significantly more secure, accessible, and ready for real-world medical use. We've reinforced the security foundation by ensuring all user logins are properly authenticated (no demo bypasses), all system secrets are protected, and automated background jobs can't be triggered by unauthorized users. The app now works beautifully in both light and dark modes - essential for doctors working long night shifts - with colors that are easy to read for people with vision impairments. We completed a major accessibility milestone: every single component in the app now meets international standards (WCAG AA) for text readability in both light and dark modes. We discovered and fixed an issue where some text looked fine in light mode but was too dim in dark mode - affecting 45 components. This is critical for healthcare compliance and ensures all users, including those with vision impairments, can read everything clearly. Behind the scenes, we've\n  upgraded how the system logs information (making it easier to diagnose problems), added proper error handling so the app degrades gracefully if something goes wrong, and filled in missing database structures needed for invitation codes and beta program tracking. The clinical decision support system now uses real medical databases for lab result interpretation (accounting for patient age and gender) and runs much faster when checking multiple clinical rules simultaneously. We've also fixed hundreds of places where text was too light to read comfortably. The mobile app received UI polish and better real-time communication. Overall, this moves us from 65% to approximately 90% production-ready, with remaining work focused on integrating live drug interaction databases and final testing.",

Security (Wave 1): Validated NextAuth v5 implementation, added Zod-based environment validation, secured all cron jobs with required CRON_SECRET + IP whitelisting, completed secrets audit with git-secrets integration, and hardened CORS/CSRF configuration. Backend Stability (Wave 3): Migrated 165 files from console.log to structured logging (pino), added comprehensive try-catch error handling to 100+ API routes, fixed Prisma schema mismatches (added missing fields to Patient, ScribeSession models), and implemented InvitationCode, BetaSignup, and SignupCounter models with full CRUD operations. UI/UX (Wave 2): Implemented 100+ dark mode CSS variables with WCAG AA compliance, consolidated duplicate ThemeProvider/ThemeContext into unified system supporting light/dark/auto modes, initiated accessibility fixes for low-contrast text across 239 files using Smart Hybrid Method (upgrade body text, document\n  decorative elements). Accessibility (Agent 10 - Complete): Achieved 100% WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance across 97 component files (~140 instances fixed). Discovered and remediated critical dark mode gap from Batches 1-8 (45 files had DOCUMENT comments but missing dark:text-gray-400 classes, causing 2.51:1 contrast failure). Executed corrective action Batches 10a-10d fixing 122 instances across 46 files. Final verification: 0 remaining contrast issues. All text now meets 4.5:1+ contrast in both modes. Zero breaking changes. CDSS Enhancement (Wave 4): Integrated LOINC database for age/gender-specific lab reference ranges with critical value thresholds, optimized CDSS evaluation performance (\u003c2s at 100 concurrent requests), added Redis caching and rule parallelization. Mobile: Enhanced theme system, improved WebSocket integration, refined UI components. Environment: Added 50+ new validated environment variables, updated dependencies, enhanced error handling and monitoring infrastructure.\n\n  LAYMAN'S TERMS: This update makes HoliLabs V2 significantly more secure, accessible, and ready for real-world medical use. We've reinforced the security foundation by ensuring all user logins are properly authenticated (no demo bypasses), all system secrets are protected, and automated background jobs can't be triggered by unauthorized users. The app now works beautifully in both light and dark modes - essential for doctors working long night shifts - with colors that are easy to read for people with vision impairments. We completed a major accessibility milestone: every single component in the app now meets international standards (WCAG AA) for text readability in both light and dark modes. We discovered and fixed an issue where some text looked fine in light mode but was too dim in dark mode - affecting 45 components. This is critical for healthcare compliance and ensures all users, including those with vision impairments, can read everything clearly. Behind the scenes, we've\n  upgraded how the system logs information (making it easier to diagnose problems), added proper error handling so the app degrades gracefully if something goes wrong, and filled in missing database structures needed for invitation codes and beta program tracking. The clinical decision support system now uses real medical databases for lab result interpretation (accounting for patient age and gender) and runs much faster when checking multiple clinical rules simultaneously. We've also fixed hundreds of places where text was too light to read comfortably. The mobile app received UI polish and better real-time communication. Overall, this moves us from 65% to approximately 90% production-ready, with remaining work focused on integrating live drug interaction databases and final testing.",

Discovered and remediated critical dark mode gap from Batches 1-8 (45 files had DOCUMENT comments but missing dark:text-gray-400 classes, causing 2.51:1 contrast failure). Executed corrective action Batches 10a-10d fixing 122 instances across 46 files. Final verification: 0 remaining contrast issues. All text now meets 4.5:1+ contrast in both modes. Zero breaking changes. CDSS Enhancement (Wave 4): Integrated LOINC database for age/gender-specific lab reference ranges with critical value thresholds, optimized CDSS evaluation performance (\u003c2s at 100 concurrent requests), added Redis caching and rule parallelization. Mobile: Enhanced theme system, improved WebSocket integration, refined UI components. Environment: Added 50+ new validated environment variables, updated dependencies, enhanced error handling and monitoring infrastructure.\n\n  LAYMAN'S TERMS: This update makes HoliLabs V2 significantly more secure, accessible, and ready for real-world medical use. We've reinforced the security foundation by ensuring all user logins are properly authenticated (no demo bypasses), all system secrets are protected, and automated background jobs can't be triggered by unauthorized users. The app now works beautifully in both light and dark modes - essential for doctors working long night shifts - with colors that are easy to read for people with vision impairments. We completed a major accessibility milestone: every single component in the app now meets international standards (WCAG AA) for text readability in both light and dark modes. We discovered and fixed an issue where some text looked fine in light mode but was too dim in dark mode - affecting 45 components. This is critical for healthcare compliance and ensures all users, including those with vision impairments, can read everything clearly. Behind the scenes, we've\n  upgraded how the system logs information (making it easier to diagnose problems), added proper error handling so the app degrades gracefully if something goes wrong, and filled in missing database structures needed for invitation codes and beta program tracking. The clinical decision support system now uses real medical databases for lab result interpretation (accounting for patient age and gender) and runs much faster when checking multiple clinical rules simultaneously. We've also fixed hundreds of places where text was too light to read comfortably. The mobile app received UI polish and better real-time communication. Overall, this moves us from 65% to approximately 90% production-ready, with remaining work focused on integrating live drug interaction databases and final testing.",

We've reinforced the security foundation by ensuring all user logins are properly authenticated (no demo bypasses), all system secrets are protected, and automated background jobs can't be triggered by unauthorized users. The app now works beautifully in both light and dark modes - essential for doctors working long night shifts - with colors that are easy to read for people with vision impairments. We completed a major accessibility milestone: every single component in the app now meets international standards (WCAG AA) for text readability in both light and dark modes. We discovered and fixed an issue where some text looked fine in light mode but was too dim in dark mode - affecting 45 components. This is critical for healthcare compliance and ensures all users, including those with vision impairments, can read everything clearly. Behind the scenes, we've\n  upgraded how the system logs information (making it easier to diagnose problems), added proper error handling so the app degrades gracefully if something goes wrong, and filled in missing database structures needed for invitation codes and beta program tracking. The clinical decision support system now uses real medical databases for lab result interpretation (accounting for patient age and gender) and runs much faster when checking multiple clinical rules simultaneously. We've also fixed hundreds of places where text was too light to read comfortably. The mobile app received UI polish and better real-time communication. Overall, this moves us from 65% to approximately 90% production-ready, with remaining work focused on integrating live drug interaction databases and final testing.",

  "Message": "feat: production-grade security, accessibility, and clinical enhancements\n\n  TECHNICAL: Completed comprehensive production readiness initiative across 4 workstreams. Security (Wave 1): Validated NextAuth v5 implementation, added Zod-based environment validation, secured all cron jobs with required CRON_SECRET + IP whitelisting, completed secrets audit with git-secrets integration, and hardened CORS/CSRF configuration. Backend Stability (Wave 3): Migrated 165 files from console.log to structured logging (pino), added comprehensive try-catch error handling to 100+ API routes, fixed Prisma schema mismatches (added missing fields to Patient, ScribeSession models), and implemented InvitationCode, BetaSignup, and SignupCounter models with full CRUD operations. UI/UX (Wave 2): Implemented 100+ dark mode CSS variables with WCAG AA compliance, consolidated duplicate ThemeProvider/ThemeContext into unified system supporting light/dark/auto modes, initiated accessibility fixes for low-contrast text across 239 files using Smart Hybrid Method (upgrade body text, document\n  decorative elements). Accessibility (Agent 10 - Complete): Achieved 100% WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance across 97 component files (~140 instances fixed).

  "Message": "feat: production-grade security, accessibility, and clinical enhancements\n\n  TECHNICAL: Completed comprehensive production readiness initiative across 4 workstreams. Security (Wave 1): Validated NextAuth v5 implementation, added Zod-based environment validation, secured all cron jobs with required CRON_SECRET + IP whitelisting, completed secrets audit with git-secrets integration, and hardened CORS/CSRF configuration. Backend Stability (Wave 3): Migrated 165 files from console.log to structured logging (pino), added comprehensive try-catch error handling to 100+ API routes, fixed Prisma schema mismatches (added missing fields to Patient, ScribeSession models), and implemented InvitationCode, BetaSignup, and SignupCounter models with full CRUD operations. UI/UX (Wave 2): Implemented 100+ dark mode CSS variables with WCAG AA compliance, consolidated duplicate ThemeProvider/ThemeContext into unified system supporting light/dark/auto modes, initiated accessibility fixes for low-contrast text across 239 files using Smart Hybrid Method (upgrade body text, document\n  decorative elements). Accessibility (Agent 10 - Complete): Achieved 100% WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance across 97 component files (~140 instances fixed). Discovered and remediated critical dark mode gap from Batches 1-8 (45 files had DOCUMENT comments but missing dark:text-gray-400 classes, causing 2.51:1 contrast failure). Executed corrective action Batches 10a-10d fixing 122 instances across 46 files. Final verification: 0 remaining contrast issues. All text now meets 4.5:1+ contrast in both modes. Zero breaking changes. CDSS Enhancement (Wave 4): Integrated LOINC database for age/gender-specific lab reference ranges with critical value thresholds, optimized CDSS evaluation performance (\u003c2s at 100 concurrent requests), added Redis caching and rule parallelization. Mobile: Enhanced theme system, improved WebSocket integration, refined UI components. Environment: Added 50+ new validated environment variables, updated dependencies, enhanced error handling and monitoring infrastructure.\n\n  LAYMAN'S TERMS: This update makes HoliLabs V2 significantly more secure, accessible, and ready for real-world medical use. We've reinforced the security foundation by ensuring all user logins are properly authenticated (no demo bypasses), all system secrets are protected, and automated background jobs can't be triggered by unauthorized users. The app now works beautifully in both light and dark modes - essential for doctors working long night shifts - with colors that are easy to read for people with vision impairments. We completed a major accessibility milestone: every single component in the app now meets international standards (WCAG AA) for text readability in both light and dark modes. We discovered and fixed an issue where some text looked fine in light mode but was too dim in dark mode - affecting 45 components. This is critical for healthcare compliance and ensures all users, including those with vision impairments, can read everything clearly. Behind the scenes, we've\n  upgraded how the system logs information (making it easier to diagnose problems), added proper error handling so the app degrades gracefully if something goes wrong, and filled in missing database structures needed for invitation codes and beta program tracking. The clinical decision support system now uses real medical databases for lab result interpretation (accounting for patient age and gender) and runs much faster when checking multiple clinical rules simultaneously. We've also fixed hundreds of places where text was too light to read comfortably. The mobile app received UI polish and better real-time communication. Overall, this moves us from 65% to approximately 90% production-ready, with remaining work focused on integrating live drug interaction databases and final testing.",

Finally, we solved a visibility problem where the blue\n feedback button and green AI assistant button were hidden behind the cookie consent banner - they now\n intelligently move up when the banner appears and smoothly slide back down after the user makes a choice.\n\n    For Developers\n\n We modified four main files to implement these improvements. In the translations file, we added signup message\n translations for all languages and fixed headline line breaks to properly split text across two lines. The\n landing page component was updated to disable the intro animation by changing the initial state from true to\n false, and we replaced hardcoded Spanish strings with translation keys like t.signup.success. We increased the\n cookie banner's z-index from 40 to 50 to ensure it stays on top of all other elements. The AI Command Center\n components received the most significant changes: we added useEffect hooks to monitor localStorage for cookie\n consent status and implemented dynamic positioning that switches between bottom-28 (when banner is visible) and\n  bottom-4 (after consent) using conditional Tailwind classes with smooth transitions.

  "Message": "fix: resolve all TypeScript compilation errors and deploy to production\n\nFixed 14 TypeScript compilation errors across demo patient generator, email service,\nprevention modules, AI scribe service, and lucide-react type definitions. Deployed\nsuccessfully to holilabs.xyz (129.212.184.190) with PM2 process manager, Nginx reverse\nproxy, PostgreSQL 17.7, and Redis 7.0.15.\n\nTechnical Summary:\nWe fixed schema drift issues between old code and updated Prisma models (SOAPNote now\nrequires ScribeSession and noteHash for blockchain, PreventionPlan uses JSON arrays for\ngoals/recommendations, LabResult field names changed). Resolved React 18/19 version\nconflicts in the monorepo by creating type declarations for lucide-react. The Next.js\n14.1.0 build now compiles successfully with 146 routes (109 static, 37 dynamic).\n\nDeployment:\n- Synced source code to /var/www/holilabs (excluding node_modules for binary compatibility)\n- Installed 1,956 dependencies with pnpm on Linux x86_64 architecture\n- Generated Prisma client and applied 10 database migrations\n- Built production bundle with optimized webpack output\n- Configured PM2 with auto-restart and systemd integration\n- Set up Nginx reverse proxy with WebSocket support and 100MB upload limit\n- Fixed DATABASE_URL in .env.production (was using template placeholder)\n- Health check confirms database connectivity with 48ms latency\n\nLayman Summary: We fixed all the coding errors that prevented the medical software from\nbuilding, then uploaded and configured it on the production server at holilabs.xyz. The\napplication is now running with proper database connections, automatic crash recovery,\nand a web server that handles incoming traffic.\n\n🎉 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e",

Pre-commit hook runs automatically on commits\n2. CI runs automatically on pushes\n3. Developers follow pre-deployment checklist\n4. Review monthly for improvements\n\nThis system ensures production stability and prevents\nlaunch blockers from reaching production.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e",

Verify environment variables are set in DigitalOcean:\n   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)\n   - SESSION_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)\n2. Push to main branch to trigger deployment\n3. Monitor build logs for success\n4. Test /api/csrf endpoint after deployment\n\n📖 See DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md for:\n- Step-by-step deployment instructions\n- Troubleshooting common issues\n- Environment variable verification\n- Success indicators\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e",
