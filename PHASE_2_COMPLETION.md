5. Previews and inserts into note
6. Time saved: 3-4 minutes

### Example 2: Drug Interaction Prevention
1. Doctor prescribes Warfarin to patient
2. Attempts to add Aspirin
3. **CDS Panel shows MAJOR alert:**
   - "Warfarin + Aspirin"
   - "Increased risk of bleeding"
   - "Recommendation: Monitor INR closely. Consider alternative."
4. Doctor adjusts prescription
5. **Potential adverse event prevented**

### Example 3: Medical Term Highlighting
1. AI Scribe transcribes: "Patient has chest pain with shortness of breath, blood pressure 150/90"
2. Terms highlighted:
   - "chest pain" (Symptom - red)
   - "shortness of breath" (Symptom - red)
   - "blood pressure" (Vital Sign - blue)
   - "150/90" (Vital Sign - blue)
3. Clinician quickly scans for medical terms
