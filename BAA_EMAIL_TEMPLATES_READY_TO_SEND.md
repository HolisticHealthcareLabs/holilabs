## üü° HIGH PRIORITY #3: PostHog Analytics BAA Request

**‚è∞ SEND TODAY - Timeline: 1-2 business days (FASTEST)**

### Send This Email

**To:** hey@posthog.com
**Subject:** HIPAA BAA Request - Healthcare Application (US Cloud)

```
Hello PostHog Team,

My name is [YOUR NAME] and I represent Holi Labs, a healthcare technology company building an AI medical scribe platform for physicians in Latin America.

We are preparing for production launch and need to execute a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) under HIPAA to ensure compliance when using PostHog for analytics.

PROJECT DETAILS:
- Company: Holi Labs
- Application: AI Medical Scribe Platform
- Production URL: https://holilabs-lwp6y.ondigitalocean.app
- PostHog Instance: US Cloud (https://us.i.posthog.com)
- Account Email: [YOUR EMAIL]

COMPLIANCE APPROACH:
We are implementing strict PHI sanitization to ensure PostHog ONLY receives de-identified data:
- User IDs: Hashed UUIDs (no real names)
- Events: Clinical workflow actions (no patient data)
- Properties: Aggregate metrics only (no PHI)

HOWEVER, out of an abundance of caution and to satisfy auditors, we would like to execute a BAA with PostHog.

PHI EXPOSURE:
- LOW - We sanitize all PHI before sending to PostHog
- Data collected: User actions, feature usage, performance metrics
- NO patient names, diagnoses, CPF numbers, or clinical notes sent to PostHog

USE CASE:
- A/B testing feature flags (dashboard layouts, AI features)
- User activation funnels (signup ‚Üí first note)
- Performance monitoring (page load times, API latency)
- Retention tracking (Day 7, Day 30 active users)

TIMELINE:
- Production launch: Week of January 20-27, 2025
- We would greatly appreciate expedited BAA execution

QUESTIONS:
1. Does PostHog US Cloud offer HIPAA BAAs?
2. What plan tier is required for BAA coverage?
3. Estimated timeline for BAA execution?
4. Any additional compliance requirements?

We love PostHog and are committed to being a long-term customer. Your analytics are critical to our product success.

Thank you for your assistance!

## üö® What If They Say No or Don't Respond?

### DigitalOcean
- **No BAA:** CRITICAL - Cannot launch. Must migrate to AWS RDS (has BAA) or Google Cloud SQL
- **No Response:** Call Premium Support directly (you have phone support now)

### Supabase
- **No BAA:** HIGH - Switch to AWS S3 (has BAA) or self-host MinIO
- **Expensive ($599/mo):** Negotiate or consider alternatives (Supabase is worth it for auth)

### PostHog
- **No BAA:** LOW - Can launch with extra PHI sanitization
- **Too Slow:** Can use without BAA if we ensure ZERO PHI in events (verify with legal)
