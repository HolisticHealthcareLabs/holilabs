## üöÄ Phase 6: Polish & Launch Prep (Week 11-12)
**Goal:** Production-ready for scale

### Testing & Quality

#### 25. Comprehensive Test Suite (16 hours)
**Why:** Bugs in production harm patients
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Quality assurance

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Unit tests** (Vitest) for utility functions:
  - Date formatting
  - Input validation (email, phone, CPF)
  - Pain score calculations
  - Medication dose calculations
  - ICD-10/CPT code validation
- [ ] **Integration tests** (Vitest) for API routes:

  - GET /api/patients/[id] (fetch patient)
  - POST /api/notes (create SOAP note)
  - POST /api/prescriptions (prescribe medication)
- [ ] **E2E tests** (Playwright) for critical workflows:
  - **Happy path:** Login ‚Üí Create patient ‚Üí Create SOAP note ‚Üí Sign note
  - **AI Scribe:** Record ‚Üí Transcribe ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Save
  - **Prescribing:** Search drug ‚Üí Select ‚Üí Configure dose ‚Üí Send to pharmacy
  - **Scheduling:** Create appointment ‚Üí Send reminder ‚Üí Check-in patient
- [ ] **Visual regression tests** (Percy or Chromatic):
  - Screenshot key pages
  - Compare before/after UI changes
- [ ] **Performance tests** (Lighthouse CI):
  - Page load speed <2s
  - Time to Interactive <3s
  - Accessibility score >90%

---

#### 26. Performance Optimization (8 hours)
**Why:** Slow = poor UX, doctors will abandon app
**Impact:** HIGH - Retention depends on speed

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Database query optimization:**
  - Add indexes to frequently queried columns (patient.mrn, user.email)
  - Use Prisma's `select` to fetch only needed fields
  - Avoid N+1 queries (use `include` with caution)
  - Add composite indexes for common filters
- [ ] **Lazy loading** for heavy components:
  - Chart libraries (Chart.js, Recharts)
  - PDF viewer
  - Rich text editor
- [ ] **Image optimization:**
  - Use Next.js `Image` component (automatic WebP)
  - Lazy load images below the fold
  - Compress images (TinyPNG)
- [ ] **Code splitting** (React.lazy):
  - Split by route (each page is separate bundle)
  - Split by feature (AI Scribe, Analytics)
- [ ] **Redis caching** for frequent queries:
  - Patient list
  - Medication catalog
  - ICD-10/CPT codes
  - Cache TTL: 5-60 minutes depending on data
- [ ] **CDN for static assets:**
  - Use DigitalOcean Spaces or Cloudflare CDN
  - Cache images, CSS, JS
- [ ] **Target metrics:**
  - Page load <2s
  - Time to Interactive <3s
  - First Contentful Paint <1s
  - Lighthouse score >90%

**Tools:**
- Lighthouse CI (automated performance testing)
- Prisma Studio (query analysis)

  - Test with NVDA (Windows)
  - Test with JAWS (Windows)
  - Test with VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
  - Ensure all images have alt text
  - Ensure all buttons have labels
- [ ] **Color contrast:**
  - Check with WebAIM contrast checker
  - Minimum 4.5:1 for text
  - Minimum 3:1 for large text (>18pt)
  - Don't rely on color alone (use icons + text)
- [ ] **Focus indicators:**
  - Visible focus outline (not `outline: none`)
  - High contrast (e.g., blue ring)
  - Consistent across site
- [ ] **ARIA labels:**
  - `aria-label` for icon buttons
  - `aria-describedby` for form help text

- [ ] **Form accessibility:**
  - Labels properly associated with inputs
  - Error messages linked with `aria-describedby`
  - Required fields marked
  - Autocomplete attributes (name, email, phone)
- [ ] **Semantic HTML:**
  - Use `<button>` not `<div onclick>`
  - Use `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`
  - Use headings in order (h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3)

**Testing Tools:**
- axe DevTools (browser extension)
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)
- Color Contrast Analyzer

**Files:**
