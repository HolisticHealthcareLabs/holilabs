## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### General Questions

**Q: Is Holilabs a complete EHR or just an AI scribe?**
A: Holilabs is a complete, integrated healthcare management platform. It includes AI-powered clinical documentation (scribe), patient management, appointment scheduling, e-prescribing, lab/imaging integration, patient portal, and billing. The AI scribe is one feature of a comprehensive system.

**Q: Can Holilabs replace our existing EHR?**
A: Yes, for most outpatient/ambulatory use cases. Holilabs is designed to be a complete replacement for traditional EHR systems in clinics and physician practices. For hospitals with complex inpatient workflows (surgery, ICU, etc.), Holilabs can integrate with existing inpatient systems via HL7/FHIR.

**Q: Does Holilabs work offline?**
A: The patient portal has limited offline functionality (view cached records). The clinical portal requires internet connection for real-time features (transcription, drug interaction checking, etc.). However, data is cached locally for performance, so brief connection interruptions won't disrupt workflows.

**Q: What happens if Holilabs goes out of business?**
A: All customer data can be exported in standard formats (CSV, JSON, FHIR). We provide 90-day transition support and data retention after contract termination. Your data always remains under your control.

### Implementation Questions

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Typical implementation timeline is 8-12 weeks from contract signing to full deployment. This includes planning, configuration, data migration, training, pilot, and rollout. Smaller clinics can go live in as little as 4 weeks.

**Q: Do you provide on-site support during implementation?**
A: Yes, Premium and Enterprise implementation packages include on-site support during go-live. We can provide on-site trainers for the first 1-2 weeks of production use.

**Q: Can we implement department by department?**
A: Yes, phased rollout is recommended. Most hospitals start with a pilot department (5-10 physicians), validate workflows, then expand to other departments over 2-3 months.

**Q: What if our staff resist the new system?**
A: Change management is included in our implementation service. We identify clinical champions, provide train-the-trainer programs, and offer ongoing support. The AI scribe feature typically creates enthusiasm as it demonstrably saves time.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Where is our data stored?**
A: Data is stored in secure cloud data centers in the nearest region: Mexico City (Mexico), São Paulo (Brazil), or Buenos Aires (Argentina). Enterprise customers can request specific data residency or private cloud deployment.

**Q: Can we integrate with our existing lab/imaging systems?**
A: Yes, we support HL7 v2.x integration for labs and DICOM for imaging. Custom API integrations are available for systems without standard interfaces. Integration is included in Premium/Enterprise implementation packages.

**Q: Do you support single sign-on (SSO)?**
A: Yes, we support SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0 for SSO integration with Active Directory, Okta, Azure AD, and other identity providers.

**Q: What is your uptime history?**
A: The platform is newly deployed in production (2025), so historical uptime data is limited. Our infrastructure is built on enterprise-grade cloud services with 99.9%+ SLAs. We commit to 99.5% uptime (Standard) to 99.95% (Enterprise).

### Compliance Questions

**Q: Is Holilabs HIPAA compliant?**
A: Yes, the platform is designed for HIPAA compliance with technical, physical, and administrative safeguards. We provide Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) to all US customers. However, compliance is a shared responsibility - hospitals must also implement proper policies and procedures.

**Q: What about LGPD (Brazilian data protection law)?**
A: Yes, Holilabs is LGPD compliant with data residency in Brazil, consent management, and data subject rights (access, deletion, portability).

**Q: Can patients access their own medical records?**
A: Yes, patients have full access to their medical records through the patient portal, in compliance with HIPAA Right of Access and LGPD data subject rights.

**Q: How do you handle data breaches?**
A: We have a formal incident response plan with automated monitoring, containment procedures, and breach notification within 24 hours. We also provide support for regulatory breach reporting obligations.

### Cost Questions

**Q: Are there hidden fees or usage charges?**
A: No hidden fees. Pricing is per clinician per month with unlimited patients, appointments, and notes. The only additional charges are optional add-ons (extra storage, custom integrations, etc.).

**Q: Is the patient portal included in the price?**
A: Yes, the patient portal is included at no additional cost with unlimited patient users.

**Q: What about AI transcription costs?**
A: AI transcription and SOAP note generation are included in the subscription price with no per-use fees. Our cost optimization technology keeps AI costs negligible (< $0.002 per note).

**Q: Do you offer non-profit or academic discounts?**
A: Yes, we offer 20% discounts for non-profit hospitals, teaching hospitals, and public health institutions. Contact sales for qualification.

### AI Questions

**Q: How accurate is the AI transcription?**
A: Our medical transcription achieves 95%+ accuracy on medical terminology in Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Accuracy improves over time as the AI learns physician speech patterns. Physicians always review and approve AI-generated notes.

**Q: Does the AI replace clinical judgment?**
A: No, the AI is a documentation assistant, not a diagnostic tool. Physicians always review, edit, and approve all AI-generated content. The AI helps with documentation efficiency but does not make clinical decisions.

**Q: What if the AI makes a mistake?**
A: All AI-generated content is clearly marked and requires physician review and approval before being finalized. Physicians can edit any AI-generated text. We track AI confidence scores and flag low-confidence sections for extra review.

**Q: Is patient data used to train AI models?**
A: No, patient data is never used to train AI models. We use pre-trained AI models from vendors (Anthropic, Google, Deepgram) with strict data processing agreements that prohibit using customer data for model training.
